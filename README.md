# âœ¨ Causal Sentiment Analysis: How Posting Time Affects Tweet Sentiment

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project investigates whether the **time a tweet is posted** causally affects its **sentiment positivity**, using a combination of **NLP** and **Causal Inference** techniques.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Approach

1. **Sentiment Prediction**  
   - Used HuggingFace Transformers to predict each tweet as **POSITIVE** or **NEGATIVE**.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Extracted Posting Hour, Time of Day, Hashtag Count, Post Length.

3. **Causal Modeling**  
   - Built a Causal DAG using DoWhy to define treatment, outcome, and confounders.
   - Adjusted for confounders using backdoor adjustment.
   - Estimated causal effect using linear regression.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Finding
- **Posting tweets in the Afternoon** increases the probability of positive sentiment by approximately **+1.67%** compared to Morning tweets.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python
- Huggingface Transformers
- pandas
- dowhy
- matplotlib

---

## ðŸ“¢ Why This Project?
Understanding causal relationships (not just correlation) is critical for **actionable decision-making** in real-world scenarios like marketing campaigns, social media optimization, and content strategy.
